##Program to map call numbers and locations to maps of library stacks

###Implementation
* The examples folder contains two versions of the program.
	* pratt_gen contains a version for a static catalog interface in which no scripts could be inserted. 
	* illinois_state contains a version developed for the EBSCO Discovery Service. This version allows for greater customization.

###Optimization
* The code was written to be as verbose as possible so that newer programmers can pinpoint the source of any location errors. 
* For a service expecting significant traffic, the code should probably be refactored to favor efficiency.

###Images
* The images folder contains samples from various stages of the project.
