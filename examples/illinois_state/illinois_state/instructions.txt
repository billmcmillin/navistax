For Sysadmin:
All the files here can be uploaded to any publicly accessible server w/ php installed. 
.htaccess and php.ini files are included, but have development settings. Most settings can 
(and probably should) be locked down a bit more. The only thing to note is that lib_http
requires curl_exe to be enabled. Once the files are uploaded, just send Anita the URL.


For Anita:

Just insert the URL from systems into the spaces indicated below and insert the code into a widget in a test version of the EDS:
	 
<script type="text/javascript" src="[insert URL from sysadmin]/jquery-1.11.1.js"></script>			
	 <script type="text/javascript" src="[insert URL from sysadmin]/linx.js"></script>
	 <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="[insert URL from sysadmin]/maps.css" media="All">
	 <div id="output"></div>
